# Design Framework Documentation

Welcome to our structured app design framework. This guide will help you create consistent, user-centered designs for your applications using our comprehensive layered approach. The framework is organized into four main layers, each building upon the previous to create a complete design system.

## Design Process

1. [Design Strategy](strategy.md) - Select and prioritize your app's core design values and characteristics
2. [Visual Theme](theme.md) - Select and customize your app's visual foundation
3. [Design Principles](principles.md) - Implement core design principles based on your strategy
4. [Implementation Plan](implementation.md) - Develop technical specifications and component patterns

## Getting Started

1. Begin by clearly defining your design strategy
2. Document all decisions in a shared location
3. Create visual examples for key components
4. Validate mobile experience first
5. Test your design system across different screen sizes and devices

Important: Remember that this is a mobile-first design framework. All design decisions should prioritize mobile experiences first, then scale up to larger screens.
